# Temperature Controlled Gate Control

Description : 
Embedded C project regarding the control of gate using body temperature , finding use cases in Covid detection and prevention .
Methodology : 
I have used an Arduino R3 as the microcontroller for the project. 
For Object detection I have used a PIR Sensor, any IR sensor would work just fine .
For sensing the temperature I have used a MLX90614 GY-906 Contactless Temperature Sensor.
For the Gate mechanism I have used a SG90 Servo Motor. 

How to Use : 
Connect the wirings as per CircuitDiagram 
Run the code from the .ino file
